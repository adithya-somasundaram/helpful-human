# Project overview

So far, I have been able to create the app which holds 100 colors in a sqlite3 generated database (generated by the
db_populate.py file). These colors are read by the connection.js file when the app is loaded and stored into the db.json file. The color swatches hold a label and when clicked upon the 
screen switches to the detailed view. The random button picks a random color
from the db and displays it in detail view. The 'Clear' button at the bottom of the
detail view returns the user back to the ListView. I was also able to import the
given Google font for the app.

# Challenges/Bugs

My biggest challenge was including the labels on the swatches. I mainly just struggled
with the sizing of them. I was also very close to getting the search functionality, but
could not pass the inputted value to the detailed view component.

# Format

There were four components I made for this app: Header, Sidebar, ListView, and
DetailedView. They are all stored in the 'components' folders and the corresponding css
files with the same name are in the 'style' folder. The database json file, the db file, and the
python scripts are in the main 'src' folder. I have added comments and am more than
willing to discuss my code/thought processes. Thank you!!!
